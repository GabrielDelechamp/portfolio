    "aboutmeparagraph":"Passionate about web development and new technologies, I am currently in my second year of a BTS SIO with a SLAM option. After a first year in mathematics, I chose to reorient myself towards computer science to combine logic and creativity in my projects. I am mainly proficient in Laravel, React.js, Tailwind CSS and Supabase, and I place particular importance on responsive development and user experience. I have worked on several projects, including an absence management application in Laravel and a data analysis application in React. Always curious to learn, I am looking for a work-study program in the field of application development, where I could use my skills and continue to progress.",
